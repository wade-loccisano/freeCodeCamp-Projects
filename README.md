# freeCodeCamp Projects

This is a repository of all the projects I have completed while learning on freeCodeCamp.

As part of my training to become a better software developer, I have begun to work through all the certifications on freeCodeCamp. This
respository will act as a log of my progress and a marker for my coding skills over time. The projects have been broken
down into folders by individual certification. My MVP goal for each project is to satisfy all user stories and pass all tests. My stretch goal will be project dependent. My meta goal is consistency in practice.

Thanks again for stopping by!

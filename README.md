# freeCodeCamp Projects

This is a repository of projects I have completed on freeCodeCamp.

As part of my training to become a better software developer, I have begun to work through all the certifications on freeCodeCamp. This
respository will act as a log of my progress and I hope to see my growth over time as my coding skills improve. The projects are broken
down into folders by certification. My MVP goal for each project is to pass all the tests. My stretch goal is to make it look as presentable as possible. I hope to be able to progress a little everyday.

Thanks again for stopping by!
